  Today was our 12 week appointment at Special Beginnings.  We heard the baby&#8217;s heart beat for the very first time.  It was the most amazing moment!  We are so happy and so proud to hear our baby&#8217;s tiny little heart beat already!

    The picture above was taken from one of our first dates back in October of 2004.  It&#8217;s been pure happiness since then!  Our happiness continues to grow with the beating of our baby&#8217;s heart!!
