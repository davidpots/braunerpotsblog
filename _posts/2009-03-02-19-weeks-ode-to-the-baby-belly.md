  Oh I love my belly! I love my belly!  I love it, I love it, I love it!!!  I love rubbing my belly, I love looking at my belly, and I love putting cocoa butter on my belly! (cocoa butter everyday in hopes of preventing stretch marks, ha ha)  Even though my belly is getting quite large, I enjoy knowing that our baby is growing quickly inside. I love you Belly!  I love you even more Baby!
