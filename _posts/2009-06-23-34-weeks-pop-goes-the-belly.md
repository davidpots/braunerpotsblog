<span><span>I feel like I am about to POP!  We are getting really excited about meeting you soon.  I can feel you hiccup often now,  I hope you don&#8217;t mind them too much.  Dad felt them for the first time on Father&#8217;s Day.  He was quite impressed.  I feel that you are trying to wiggle down into the right position, I hope that you are able to soon because things are getting tight in there!<br /> </span></span>
