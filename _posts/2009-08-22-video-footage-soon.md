Norah is absolutely adorable! She is starting to make ahhh sounds and has been sticking her tongue out too.  It&#8217;s so much fun staring at her pretty face, it&#8217;s an incredible feeling when she looks back at us. We also love the way she moves her tiny little arms and legs around!  My heart is filled with happiness!
