We couldn&#8217;t&#8217; wait to bring you to your first baseball game!  We loved going to baseball games with our family when we were younger.  We had a triple date and went with the Taylor and Kantor Family.  You had fun sitting next to your buddies.  You clapped your hands and applauded when the crowd cheered.  We love our little O&#8217;s fan!
