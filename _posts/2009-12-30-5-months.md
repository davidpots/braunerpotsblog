Norah you have brought so much joy to our lives.  I look forward to waking up each day because I get to see your pretty face.  I love the first moment we see each other in the morning,  you give Daddy & I the biggest smiles.  We feel so blessed to receive such a beautiful gift each day.  I will hold these special moments forever in my heart.  My dear Norah Belle thanks for making the past five months incredible!
