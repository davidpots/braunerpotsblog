My first pre-natal appointment at Special Beginnings was really exciting.  My best friend Jessie is pregnant too! We are about 7 days apart in our pregnancy, she is ahead of me, thank goodness!  That way she can give me advice on the labor part.  We are going to have so much fun being pregnant together!
