Norah&#8217;s 18 months update&#8230; This Toddler loves to sing, her favorite songs this week are the alphabet, bah bah (black sheep), row row (your boat), and lou lou (skip to my lou). She has also started to recognize &#8220;You Are My Sunshine&#8221;. The first word she grasped of it was &#8220;Happy&#8221;, you make me &#8220;Happy&#8221; so far that is the only part she sings along with. Norah you are my sunshine and you make me happy!
