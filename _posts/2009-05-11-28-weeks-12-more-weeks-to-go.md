We had our 28 week apt on May 8th.  The baby&#8217;s heart rate is perfect and my blood pressure is too.   I am entering my 3rd Trimester, 12 more weeks to go!!  Now I will start going for visits every 2 weeks.  I enjoyed the 2nd Trimester so much but look forward to meeting our baby soon.  The baby is extremely active now,  he/she  moves around a lot when I am working but  most of the action happens at night when I go to sleep.   I guess the baby is trying to prepare me for all those night feedings.  Cool baby developments, the baby is about 2.5 lbs now,  is developing billions of neurons in his/her brain and adding more body fat in preparation for life in the outside world.    Oh I can&#8217;t wait!!
