Norah our little Sunshine Sunflower,  
Your face is prettier than the most beautiful flower.  Your spirit is as bright as a sunny day.  The day you were born was the happiest day of our lives.  I promise to be here for you forever and ever.  These first few weeks have been amazing and my favorite part of the day is holding and admiring you.  You are so special and I know you will bring great joy to our lives.  I love you more than you could ever imagine.</div>
