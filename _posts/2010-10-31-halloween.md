Happy 15 month birthday and happy Halloween!  When we ask you what you are going to be for Halloween you say with excitement &#8220;nemo&#8221;! It&#8217;s really the cutest thing in the world.  We wanted to start a family tradition of dressing up for Halloween so daddy and I found costumes this year. We went trick or treating with our friends and ate all of your candy! It was so FUN!
