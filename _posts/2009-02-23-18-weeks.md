Oh to my beautiful baby&#8230; be you a boy or a girl.  Your pending arrival has brought a life changing amount of joy, happiness, and excitement into the lives of your mother and father.  Although you have not seen the light of day, all manner of birds and bee&#8217;s and flowers and trees are singing in anticipation of your arrival!  As for the news of the day, Obabma gave his first speech to Congress, Amazon&#8217;s Kindle #2 just came out, American Idol is in it&#8217;s 9th season and Maryland is about to whoop Duke in basketball.  18 weeks so far so good, keep it up and stay strong!
