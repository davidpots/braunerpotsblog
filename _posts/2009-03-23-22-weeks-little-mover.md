  I feel the baby move around all the time now.  I think I felt the baby move  for the first time around 17 weeks but was unsure because it was such a small feeling.  Then,  it felt like a butterfly moving around.  By the feel of the baby&#8217;s little kicks I can tell the baby is a strong little thing,  possibly a dancer or soccer player? The baby moves around the most after dinner.  That&#8217;s normally when the baby gives a shout out to Dave whom likes to place his hand on my belly to catch some of the kicks.
