Halloween was fun! Norah was Max from the book and recent movie &#8220;Where the Wild Things Are&#8221;. This was one of my favorite books to read when I was a kid. Norah recently got the book and had a bear outfit that reminded us of the one in the story! All we needed was a crown for our little princess of the &#8220;Wild Things&#8221; and the rest was pure cuteness!
