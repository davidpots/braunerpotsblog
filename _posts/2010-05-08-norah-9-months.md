Sunflower Norah, in this past week many things have happened, you have two bottom teeth now,  you crawl scoot across the floor, you talk a lot, play peek a boo, clap your hands,  laugh when you see your doggy Lily, and yell back at Lily when she barks! I can&#8217;t believe summer is almost here, which means we are 3 months away from approaching a year with you. It&#8217;s absolutely mind blowing how quickly the time goes by and how quickly you advance to the next developmental milestone. It sure is fascinating to watch you, but most of all it&#8217;s amazing to love you.
