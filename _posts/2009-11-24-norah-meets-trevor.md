Thanksgiving was really special this year because the whole family was together and Norah met Aunt Heather, Uncle Jay, and her cousin Trevor!  It was exciting seeing Norah and Trevor together for the first time.  This Thanksgiving we are thankful for our little nephew Trevor.  He  is doing great and is almost walking!
