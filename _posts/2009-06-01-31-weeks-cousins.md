  This past week  we had a fun visit with Potsiadlo California family!  Our niece and nephew Anya and Tyler are really excited about having a new cousin soon.  They both have already decided on names for baby Pots&#8230;. if it is a boy they like the name Speed Racer and if it&#8217;s a girl they like the name Princess. So cute!
