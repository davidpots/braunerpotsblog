Norah is amazing! She sings many songs, talks in full senteces, and counts to the # 14! She loves to ask mommy daddy what are you doing? Then she gives the answer before we can. &#8220;Daddy what are you doing? ; Daddy are you driving the car?&#8221; She also says &#8220;I love you&#8221; and &#8220;give me a kiss&#8221;. It&#8217;s like birds singing in the springtime when I hear Norah&#8217;s sweet lil voice say &#8220;Mommy I love you&#8221; and &#8220;Daddy I love you&#8221;. Norah&#8217;s favorite thing to do at baby gym is to hang like a monkey and fall from the bar to her bottom. I love you Norah our little baby monkey!
