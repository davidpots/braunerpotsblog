WOW the BIG 2-0 months is getting closer to the big 2! Norah LOVES to read and spend time at the library. She loves to turn each page really fast when she holds the book. When she hits the last page she yells &#8220;the end&#8221;! Then she jumps off her chair and runs to find another book while singing. She&#8217;s the loudest toddler in the library! At home her favorite books are Daddy Loves Me, What Does Baby Say, Rusty Robot, and Chick (a pop up book with a story about a baby chicken). She has these books almost memorized. We enjoy reading time as much as she does because she actually sits in our laps for more than a few minutes and we get some quality snuggle time.
