Norah&#8217;s first Christmas began at Christmas Eve Mass, the caroling was beautiful and put our little angel into a heavenly sleep.  The Christmas spirit filled our hearts and we were overjoyed with happiness.  The next morning we woke up on Nightsong Lane at Go Go & Pop Pops.  We all opened our gifts together near the beautifully decorated tree. Norah loved every minute and we all enjoyed watching her in excitement.  Her thoughts were, &#8220;yum presents taste good, the ribbons are pretty, my dress feels neat, and I want to eat my feet!&#8221;
