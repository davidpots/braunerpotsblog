What a life changing week!  Having Norah home makes it finally seem real.  I get overwhelmed with emotions when I think about our incredible journey to this present moment.  It feels amazing to have a family, the three of us together in our home, (such sweet love!).  Norah updates, she is a sleeping beauty just like her mommy! She loves daddy&#8217;s  voice and enjoys it when he reads stories to her.  We love being parents!
