You are so ADORABLE!!  You look like an astronaut floating around in the womb of outer space.  You are currently 11 ounces and look healthy.  You were moving around a lot at the sonogram, at one point you even gave us a thumbs up when we were looking your hands and arms.  Which are so precious by the way! We got a close frontal look of your face, and we could even see your ears. Your ears are so cute!  Your strong little feet (the photo below the face) are beautiful too! It was a fascinating experience getting a sneak peak at you!  We are still keeping the surprise of finding out whether your a boy or girl, 20 more weeks to find out&#8230;
