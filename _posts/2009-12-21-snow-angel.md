Norah is now 20 weeks old and life keeps getting more beautiful each day.  What a special weekend it was for all of us, it was Norah&#8217;s first snow, 18 inches of it that is!  We took Norah out in the winter wonderland today.  She enjoyed looking at the snow and putting her feet in it.  She even made her first snow angel.
