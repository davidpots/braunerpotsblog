We spent New Years Eve with the Taylor family.  Norah and Colin celebrated their very first New Years Eve together! Norah was wide awake and ready to party.  She loved her fun feathers and the excitement on everyone&#8217;s faces.  We loved that she was having such a good time.  Happy New Year to everyone, it&#8217;s going to be fabulous!
