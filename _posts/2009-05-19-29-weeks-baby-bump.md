Wow 29 weeks!  My Baby Bump is growing more than I ever imagined!!  The crazy thing is that over the next 11 weeks, our baby will double, or even come close to tripling, his/her weight.  Yikes!  I am still loving every minute of being pregnant.  It&#8217;s hard not having stomach muscles but I enjoy the break from sit ups.  I like to put on my old t-shirts and see how much my belly hangs out! I guess this shirt has reached it&#8217;s full belly capacity.
