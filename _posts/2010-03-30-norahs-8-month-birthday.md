Norah my love, happy 8 month birthday!! These are the best days of my life, watching you grow&#8230; Your favorite activities are play dates with Colin & Finn, baby yoga, swimming, story time, listening/dancing to music, and people watching. When you people watch you wait until someone makes eye contact with you and then you give them a BIG smile.Â  Grandpa Brauner introduces you as &#8220;Princess Norah&#8221; now and tells people to kiss your hand as you meet them. I think that you definitely have a star quality, I can see the twinkle in your eyes and your a little dramatic to be completely honest! I love who you are and everything you do!
