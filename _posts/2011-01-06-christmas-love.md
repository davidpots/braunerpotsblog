Another magical holiday with Norah! This year Christmas was extra special because Norah&#8217;s Great Grandma Brauner came over the river and through the woods to Maryland to spend the holidays with us. Christmas Eve we went to a beautiful mass with mom, dad, Lena, and Eric on Solomons where Dave and I were married. Norah enjoyed all the people and sang along to the Christmas music. She&#8217;s so full of spirit and lights up our world. We had a wonderful family visit and look forward to more family adventures in 2011!
