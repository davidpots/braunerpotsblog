Norah has been so excited about the days leading up to her birthday. She&#8217;s been talking about it&#8230; &#8220;On my birthday I&#8217;m going to eat cake and have a candle&#8221;. When we say &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; Norah smiles big and says &#8220;Thank You&#8221;. She picked out her own cake (chocolate) and candles (purple with sparkles on them). When it was time to sing Daddy grabbed the guitar and Norah got extremely shy tucking her face into her high chair. She felt better once Daddy said that he would blow out the candles with her. There was not any face diving or hand grabbing of the cake, she was very classy for 2! She also snuck away from all the action of the party and opened a gift by herself and she loved gift opening time. TWO oh how we love YOU!
