<span id="__caret">We finally have a few boy & girl names picked out but will be keeping them a surprise.  We will decide on one after we meet you.  It seemed to be much easier for us to find girl names than boy names, so I am wondering if  that&#8217;s a sign that you might be a girl?  You must be quite comfortable if you are still sitting head up!</span> Yo Daddy thinks you&#8217;re &#8220;acting like Indiana Jones, hurrying to decode a secret message written on the wall before racing back to the closing trap door.&#8221;  The fact that you have us waiting in suspense makes me think that you are a boy!
