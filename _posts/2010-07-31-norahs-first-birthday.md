Happy 1st Birthday Norah! We had so much fun watching you turn 1! Your favorite song to sing is, fly fly butterfly. Because you love butterflies so much, we had a butterfly face painting party. There were many wonderful friends and family at your party, even the California Potsiadlo Clan made it to celebrate! You really enjoyed all the attention and loved hearing everyone sing Happy Birthday to YOU. I hope you enjoyed blowing out your 1 candle for the very 1st time! We have a lifetime of wonderful wishes for our beautiful little butterfly!
