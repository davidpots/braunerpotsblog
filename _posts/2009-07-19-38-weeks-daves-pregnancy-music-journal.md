Hello all! This is Dave at the helm once again. I would like to take you all on a retrospective tour of the last nine months from the perspective of a first time father-to-be. To add a twist to things, I’ve selected a favorite song that I listened to that particular month to accompany my thoughts.

  Prologue: Life Thus Far
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **“Furr”** by Blitzen Trapper:

<div class="song_player">
</div>

Before we move into the pregnancy, allow me to use this song as an overture to set the stage. More than any other song, this one seems to perfectly sum up my experience of “college life” – the transition both into and out of that time of my life. Those were truly magical days. Living with great friends year after year left us with no shortage of great memories.

<blockquote class="journal_quote">
  <p>
    “So, from the cliffs and highest hill<br /> Yeah, we would gladly get our fill<br /> Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn” (0:46)
  </p>
</blockquote>

As great as everything was in those days, things became unbelievably more incredible when I met Shannon in 2004. We embarked on the beginning steps of our lifelong adventure together, which after almost five years would have us standing at the doorsteps of parenthood. Such a wonderful journey so far, and I can only imagine what’s in store for the future.

<blockquote class="journal_quote">
  <p>
    “So, I took her by the arm / We settled down upon a farm<br /> And raised our children up as gently as you please&#8230;” (2:32)
  </p>
</blockquote>

But this only sets the stage. For, in late November 2008 we received some most-excellent news. Thus begins the month-by-month recap, accompanied by the memorable songs that sounded the way.

<h2 class="div">
  Month 1: Joy, Discovery, Celebration!
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **“Strawberry Swing”** by Coldplay:

<div class="song_player">
</div>

This song perfectly sums up the emotions I felt upon learning we would be having a child: joy, discovery, celebration. Just as the song says, everything was perfect; we didn’t want to change a thing. Whether it be the song lyrics or the fact that it was winter when we heard this news, I cannot help but imagine a snow-covered city street, the warmth of golden streetlights, a gentle sea of peacefully moving people, and in the midst of it all a couple entwined in the joy of such wondrous news.

There is a slight hint of that which is unknown and uncertain (the briefly minor shift in tone around 2:35), but soon enough the song swings back into proper character and drives home the central theme.

<blockquote class="journal_quote">
  <p>
    “Oh, the sky could be blue, I don’t mind<br /> Without you, its a waste of time<br /> Could be blue, could be grey<br /> Without you, I’m just miles away” (3:10)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="div">
  Month 2: Long Road Ahead
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **&#8220;White Winter Hymnal&#8221;** by Fleet Foxes:

<div class="song_player">
</div>

The joy of discovery had arrived, and it would surely stay with us. However, soon thereafter came the first realizations of the long road we had in front of us. Nine months? It seemed like forever. Getting from week 7 to week 9 to week 11 seemed like an eternity: all we could do was take it one day at a time and hang on tight to the hope that everything would be okay.

This was around December 2008 / January 2009, and given the full onset of winter this month’s song seemed the perfect fit. The imagery is that of traveling through a winter landscape, drudging through the thick snow, holding fast to perseverance, resolve, and gentle determination. It was all that we could do, and so it was done well. We buckled down, tucked in our chins, and marched onward into the unknown.

<blockquote class="journal_quote">
  <p>
    “I was following the pack / all swallowed in their coats,<br /> With scarves of red tied ‘round their throats<br /> To keep their little heads / from falling in the snow&#8230;” (0:16)
  </p>
</blockquote>

  Month 3: Turning Inward, Gathering Strength
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **“Acid Tongue”** by Jenny Lewis.

<div class="song_player">
</div>

The theme from the previous month continues, more or less: during a long trek through the winter snow, we settle down for a night of brief rest. Surrounded by unforgiving darkness and bitter cold, we find solace in the warmth of a fire. Mesmerized by the flames, we reflect upon paths previously trodden and the road yet to be traveled.

About to usher new life into this world, I was reminded of the fact that I, too, have transitioned from newborn to child to adolescent to adult. I’ve had adventures of my own, experiencing my share of growth & discovery. All of these things would continue, of course, but my primary role was about to shift to that of a parent & provider. I certainly felt accepting & prepared to take on this challenge (and still do of course!), but this “pending parenthood” realization was something that hit me a little bit more each passing day. Quite heavy, as Doc Brown would say. This was a time of introspection and looking back, but also gathering strength and sharpening resolve for the road ahead.

  Month 4: The Place We Call Home
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **“Our House”** by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.

<div class="song_player">
</div>

The winter trek through the valley was finally over: we made it to the hillsides just in time for spring to arrive. We’re greeted with longer days and warmer temperatures. Most importantly, the focus turns from getting mentally prepared to that of buckling down and getting to actual business. Primary task at hand? Pimping out the homefront (or, “nesting” if you prefer that term).

For the first several spring weekends, I spent day upon day in the yard. What was previously “yardwork” now became known as “gardening.” My favorite memory from this era? Loading up my humble Honda Civic at Home Depot with a few dozen bags of stones for our yard, all the while blasting “Our House” by CSNY through car stereo (wouldn’t that make a good commercial?). At the end of this initial spurt of housework, I felt that much better about the place we call home – which will soon enough be getting a population boost of one.

<blockquote class="journal_quote">
  <p>
    “Our house / is a very, very, very fine house,<br /> With [one dog] in the yard / life used to be so hard,<br /> Now, everything is better ‘cause of you” (1:23)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="div">
  Month 5: A Love that Grows
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **“Never Knew Your Name”** by Mason Jennings.

<div class="song_player">
</div>

A love for something that was always there, but never identifiable: that is one way to over-simplify the crux of this month’s song. I’m speaking about the love for the growing baby, of course. My heart seems to swell with capacity each and every month. While this growing love is new, in a certain way I feel as though it has always been there – at least in potential. I suppose I’ve never had such a perfect little growing child to pull it out of me&#8230; and I’m certain that what I’ve felt thus far is nothing compared to what’s coming.

Meanwhile, we continue along smoothly with the preparation. Even when things get a little heated, we remember why we’re doing this and “learn to love the flames,” as the song says (0:14).

<blockquote class="journal_quote">
  <p>
    “Put the ghost in my sail / Put the spin in my wheel<br /> Roll me up in your heart / Oh, make it seem real<br /> I’m clay in your hands / I’m the ball in your game<br /> I’ve been loving you forever, but I never knew your name” (1:33)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="div">
  Month 6: Coming Into Focus
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **“Strange Overtones”** by David Byrne & Brian Eno:

<div class="song_player">
</div>

A milestone of tremendous joy came at around this time. Shannon’s baby-bump was growing, now becoming somewhat (beautifully) large. Previously, I had been able to occasionally feel the baby move with a fortunately placed hand upon her belly, but these movements thus far were small and very abstract.

But not any longer. At this point, the baby was large enough to produce movements you could actually put into context. We would watch for seemingly hour as a stray bump would move across her belly, trekking from this side to that. The real magic from all of this came in the form of being able to actually imagine the little guy/girl right there in her belly.

As these experiences piled up, our bond with the baby continued to grow. Slowly, it became increasingly easier to make conjectures of what the baby might be like in this regard or that. We couldn’t help but glean traces of personality. As such, this song was perfect: these “strange overtones” we picked up on account of the baby’s growth got the snowball rolling. From this point out, this baby actually felt like an individual with a mind of its own – and this would only continue to amaze us. It was utterly mind-blowing that there is still a lifetime of growth that will follow.

<blockquote class="journal_quote">
  <p>
    “I wake up every morning / I hear your feet on the stairs<br /> You&#8217;re in the next apartment / I hear you singing over there” (0:31)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Strange overtones, in the music you are playing” (1:14)
  </p>

<h2 class="div">
  Month 7: To Boldly Go
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **“Cape Canaveral”** by Conor Oberst:

<div class="song_player">
</div>

Getting closer now. Starting to think a lot about potential: our child, our family, the collective spirit of humankind, and far beyond. This song paints a very beautiful, introspective picture of all these things, in a sense. The crowning image is that of a shuttle launching at Cape Canaveral.

Now, let me say: one of the softest spots in all of my heart is reserved for those brave souls who venture into space. In my eyes, this endeavor is symbolic of the greatest strivings of mankind: that of exploration, discovery, and all those other things they name the space shuttles after. I could go on forever about this, but for now, I will simply say I have never before seen a live space shuttle launch – and I fully plan on checking this goal off the bucket-list in the next few years.

Given that we have family & friends in Florida, making this trip happen is not an issue. But what makes it exciting is that we’ll have our child there with us. And other family, and friends. Thinking of all these collective adventures we will have together – all the untold boundaries to be crossed and worlds to be explored – I become truly excited at the legacy of discovery that awaits.

  Month 8: Bags Packed & Ready to Go
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **“This is Not a Test”** by She & Him:

<div class="song_player">
</div>

Here we are, just about knocking at parenthood’s door. At this point we’ve finished nearly all of our preparation: birthing class, bags packed, supplies procured, house in order, etc. Just about as ready as ready can be. Yes indeed, “this is not a test.” With all this said, I humbly submit to having no idea what to really expect the next stage to bring – and can say I am pretty okay with that.

It is certainly unfortunate that we had to deviate from our natural birth plan on account of the baby’s breech position – yet my role as Shannon’s partner fundamentally does not change. Even in the face of uncertainty, I expect nothing less of myself than to bring my full presence and unwavering attention. May I remain still & centered in the face of whatever storms may arise! From this point comes proper action&#8230; and I shall do my best!

<blockquote class="journal_quote">
  <p>
    “For those of you who tried, but didn’t make it<br /> Settle down, it’s never what you think&#8230;<br /> The summit doesn’t differ from the deep, dark valley<br /> And the valley doesn’t differ from the kitchen sink. (0:15)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;This is not a test / no, this is not a test&#8230;” (1:20)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="div">
  Month 9: Where Words Turn Back
</h2>

This month&#8217;s song is **“Division”** by Moby:

<div class="song_player">
</div>

And finally, here we are. Nothing more to add, except for the following.

What will it be like to hold the baby for the first time? I do not know, but immediately upon hearing this song, I knew at once that this would be my personal soundtrack to that experience if it were a movie. Though it is merely a simple, 2-minute instrumental piece – I find it utterly transcendant. No lyrics are necessary, because I imagine words could do no justice (the realm &#8220;where words turn back,&#8221; as says the Hindu Upanishads). It simply takes me away&#8230; so much so that I consciously have avoided playing it more than a few times since, just to preserve that initial feeling.

And with these words, my entry comes to an end. I hope you’ve enjoyed my story thus far&#8230; I’m guessing there will be plenty more to write about in the very near future and beyond.
