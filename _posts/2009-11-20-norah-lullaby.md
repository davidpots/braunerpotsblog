Norah is sweet sixteen, sixteen weeks that is! She is doing so many amazing things now. She reaches for toys, holds them, and is noticing her feet. She also laughs when she finds something funny, it&#8217;s the cutest thing in the whole world!! One of her FAVORITE things right now is listening to her daddy play the guitar and sing to her.
