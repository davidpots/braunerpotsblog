David & Jessie&#8217;s baby has arrived!! Born at 7:18 p.m. on Tuesday July 21, 2009, weight  7 lb 6 oz.  Dave and I were there for most of the labor and listened outside the room as Colin was entering the world!  Jessie had a beautiful water birth, getting to be a part of her birth was the next best thing since we are unable to.  She labored for 30 hours with no pain medication!!  She did such an amazing job.  It was by far one of the most beautiful things we have ever experienced. As for us we are doing great and are ready for our turn!
