Dave has been playing his guitar and writing many new songs over the past couple months.  His latest single hit is &#8220;A Family Fine&#8221; dedicated to me and baby.  You can listen to the sound file below.  For other music we have been listening to&#8230; David Byrne & Brian Eno: Everthing That Happens will Happen Today, Cold Play: Viva La Vida,  She & Him: Volume One, and my favorite the Fleet Foxes.  I hope baby likes the albums too, since baby is able to hear noises outside of the womb now.

Here&#8217;s our baby&#8217;s first song!  &#8220;A Family Fine&#8221;.
