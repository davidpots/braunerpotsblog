Spring arrived for a day in February so we took the babes to Summerseat farm. They got to feed bunnies, pigs, cows, and even a donkey. It was super cute hearing them imitate all the animal sounds. Especially the donkey, since Dave just taught Norah that one. Norah enjoys being her own little explorer walking huge distances ahead of us. These babes are growing up way to quick, we had a hard time keeping up with them. It&#8217;s always great to spend time together, especially on beautiful sunny days.
