Last night your daddy and I had one last date together before you were born. We went to the Great Sage, one of our favorite places to eat.  We had great conversation about you. It&#8217;s incredible that you have been with us for nine months and now we finally get to meet you!  All our life was leading to this place that so many people adventure into, having a family&#8230; It&#8217;s amazing how much love parents have in their hearts for their children, I don&#8217;t think we realized that until now!
