We had our 33 week apt on Friday June 12, my weight, size of my belly, and baby&#8217;s heart beat are all perfect.&nbsp; Baby is still feet down but we are continuing with the exercises, chiropractor, and accupuncture.&nbsp; My belly measures exactly 33 1/2 centimeters.&nbsp;&nbsp; A neat little fact, the centimeters should align right up with how many weeks baby is.&nbsp; So about 6-7 more centimeters to grow!&nbsp; Our love keeps growing for you baby every day, it&#8217;s unmeasureable!
