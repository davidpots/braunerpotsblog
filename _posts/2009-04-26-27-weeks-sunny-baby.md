  We went to Treasure Island Florida for a family gathering to celebrate Jay & Heather&#8217;s marriage.  There was beautiful weather everyday and even more beautiful sunsets.  We all had such a great time!  This was the first time the baby belly felt the Florida sunshine.  Another cool baby development, the baby is now opening his/her eyes and responds to light.  Most of the family says that I am carrying girl and Grandma Corsaut said that I looked like her when she carried twins! Thanks Grandma C, ha ha!  Grandma Brauner says it&#8217;s a boy and so do most of our friends.  So we shall see&#8230;.
