I have been swimming almost daily and it has been really enjoyable.  I can&#8217;t wait to take you to the pool after you are born!  Hopefully you will be a water baby just like I was.  Today before going to the pool, Dave snapped this picture of me.  I think this swimsuit really shows how amazingly large my belly has grown!
