Uh oh! We found out at our last apt. that baby has not yet flipped into the head-down position.  We still have some time, but doctors would like to see baby&#8217;s head down as soon as possible.  Luckily, there are some exercises and things that we can do to encourage the baby to flip.  We were hoping for a natural childbirth but if baby doesn&#8217;t flip by due date we may have to schedule a Cesarean.

There&#8217;s also good news &#8212; we got another sneak peak at baby Pots with a sonogram!  Everything looked perfect and baby still has plenty of room to flip.  The baby was moving around a lot at the sonogram.  Another cute thing, our baby currently has a head full of hair.  Isn&#8217;t that sweet, a head full of baby hair!  Here is a video clip of the sonogram that Dave was able to covertly sneak with his handy assortment of skills.  It&#8217;s hard to see or hear anything on the sonogram screen but you can see my nice growing belly! Everyone together, now: flip, baby, flip!
