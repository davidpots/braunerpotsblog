Hello everyone, this is Dave!  Fatherhood is approaching&#8230; time to write a Tonight we went to the birthing center for our &#8220;dress rehearsal&#8221; class.  Joined by a dozen other soon-expecting couples, we all gathered around our favorite midwife to touch base with the procedures we&#8217;ll follow on the onset of labor.  Although we&#8217;ve heard these instructions several times in the past 8-9 months, there was a definite sense of &#8220;get ready, here this comes&#8221; in the air. Afterward we went out for a late bite to eat with Jessie & Dave, who (as you surely know, being an avid reader) are just a week ahead of us in their collective pregnancy.  It has truly been great to go through this adventure with such good friends&#8230; and of course we have a lifetime of memories heading our way as the children grow together.

  Upon our departure, I snapped this picture of Shannon & Jessie standing belly-to-belly in front of the map&#8217;s majestic glow.  Quite adorable, aren&#8217;t they?
