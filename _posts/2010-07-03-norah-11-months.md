WOW! Norah you are one month away from your 1st birthday!  You do so many cool things now, you are a super fast crawler, you still love to be out in the world, and today you started to say PeekBOO while playing with mommy.  You still have a smile with with just two bottom teeth and it&#8217;s adorable.  You are a true Maryland baby now, we took you crabbing and you enjoyed every minute!
