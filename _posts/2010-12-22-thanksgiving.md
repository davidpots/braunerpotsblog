This year was extra special it was the first Brauner-Potsiadlo family Thanksgiving celebration! My dad fried a turkey and thank goodness he didn&#8217;t burn down the Potsiadlo&#8217;s deck! Norah was one lucky little Thanksgiving girl having both sets of grandparents with her on our special Thanksgiving day.
