Currently the baby&#8217;s heart is beating about 100 to 160 times a minute almost twice as fast as mine and is about the size of a lentil bean!  WOW!

Our little baby &#8220;bean&#8221; took it&#8217;s first flight today.  We traveled with Mom & Dad Potsiadlo to San Francisco to visit John, Nina, Anya, and Tyler.  We celebrated Tyler and Anya&#8217;s 4th Birthday.   We had a lot of fun playing with them and got a glimpse into the lives of a 4 years old, quite fun actually! We had an awesome time!

Another cool thing, we spent a day in San Francisco, riding the trolley and site seeing.  We went down to Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf for lunch.  My dad told me how before I was born (across the bridge in Oakland) he brought my mom to Fisherman&#8217;s&#8217; Wharf to walk around to speed up her pre-labor.  Neat to know where I was walking around at the age of 27, I was once floating around in my mommy&#8217;s belly at the age of 9 months!
