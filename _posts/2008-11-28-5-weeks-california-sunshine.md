Currently the baby's heart is beating about 100 to 160 times a minute almost twice as fast as mine and is about the size of a lentil bean!  WOW!

Our little baby 'bean' took it's first flight today.  We traveled with Mom & Dad Potsiadlo to San Francisco to visit John, Nina, Anya, and Tyler.  We celebrated Tyler and Anya's 4th Birthday.   We had a lot of fun playing with them and got a glimpse into the lives of a 4 years old, quite fun actually! We had an awesome time!

Another cool thing, we spent a day in San Francisco, riding the trolley and site seeing.  We went down to Fisherman's Wharf for lunch.  My dad told me how before I was born (across the bridge in Oakland) he brought my mom to Fisherman's' Wharf to walk around to speed up her pre-labor.  Neat to know where I was walking around at the age of 27, I was once floating around in my mommy's belly at the age of 9 months!
